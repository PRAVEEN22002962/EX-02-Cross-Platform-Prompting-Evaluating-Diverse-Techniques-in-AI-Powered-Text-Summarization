# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.
